# Final-Project
## 2019 NBA Champion Toronto Raptors Analysis

### Topic
For my final project, I will be examining a database of the NBA Finals winners the Toroto Raptors from the 2018-2019 NBA season. 

### Topic Reasoning
I will be researching the Toronto Raptors games and players in order to examine the performance of the team overall during the 2018-2019 playoffs. To study the data collected, we will be examining by downloading a dataframe of the different NBA stastics such as player and team stats during the playoff period in order to analyze. We will do this by create models through machine learning, database collection analysis, and a google presentation in order to explain the performance of the team on their way to the NBA Championship.

### Description of data source
For my data source, I was able to find a dataset of the NBA champion Toronto Raptors 2018-2019 season from the Kaggle data Website. From this website, you can access many different sporting stasticics from all over, and for our project we are spefically targeting the NBA. I was able to search through their NBA data collection set in order to find the right database needed for my analysis on the 2018-2019 Toronto Raptors Organization. I believe that these CSV files that I have collected will be ideal to use for machine learning processes in order to find the performance results and outcomes I am searching for.

### Questions we will try to answer in our analysis
- What is the total minutes played for each player compared to the overall score of the game?
- What is the amount of attempts for the team compared to the made attempts during the season?
- Based on the game being home or away, what is the Win versus Loss percentage for the season?
- What is the actual amount of points overall compared to how many assists lead to it?
- The teams key ststitics from games compared to the actual team outcome of the game?

### Communication Protocols
for my project as far as communication, I am working solo on this project. However, I will creating a list of all the requirments for each week from the Rubrics given for each segment. This will keep me in order and on time to develop our project at the right pace.
