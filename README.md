# Final-Project
## NBA Finals and League MVP Correlation

### Topic
For my final project, I will be examining a database of the NBA Finals and Leage MVP from the years 1956-2018. 

### Topic Reasoning
I will be researching the NBA Finals and NBA league MVP to find if their is a true correlation between having the "Most Valuable Player" in the league and the chances of making the NBA Finals and winning a Chapionship. To study the data collected, we will be examining by downloading a dataframe of these two different NBA stastics in order to create models through machine learning, database collection analysis, and a google presentation in order to explain the effects each have on the other.

### Description of data source
For my data source, I was able to find a perfect dataset of the NBA Finals and MVP data coming from the data.world website. From this website, you can access many different sporting stasticics including the NBA. I was able to search through their NBA data collection set in order to find the right database needed for my project to come alive. I believe that this excel file that I will transform into a csv in order to use for machine learning processes will be enough in order to find the reuslts and outcomes I am searching for

### Questions we will try to answer
- What is the effect of having the NBA League MVP have on making it to the finals?
- How many times has the team without the NBA league MVP made it finals?
- What is the effect of having the NBA League MVP have on winning an NBA Championship?
- How many times has the team without the NBA league MVP won the championship?
- Is there a direct correlation with having the League MVP on your team to winning the NBA championship?

### Communication Protocols
for my project as far as communication, I am creating a list of all the requirments for each week from the Rubrics given for each segment. This will keep me in order and on time to develop our project at the righ pace.
