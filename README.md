# Final-Project
## NBA Finals and League MVP

### Topic
For my final project, I will be examining a database of the NBA Finals and the NBA League MVP to see the correlations and results. 

### Topic Reasoning
I will be researching the NBA Finals and the NBA league MVPs since the year 1956-218 in order to examine the correlations between the two different NBA statistics. To study the data collected, we will be examining by downloading a dataframe of the different NBA stastics such NBA Finals Champions and NBA League MVP in order to analyze. We will do this by creating models through machine learning, database collection analysis, and a google presentation in order to explain the similarities and differences of the NBA League MVP and NBA Finals Champions have on each other.

### Description of data source
For my data source, I was able to find a dataset of the NBA Finals Campions and the NBA League MVPs from the data.world Website. From this website, you can access many different sporting stasticics from all over, and for our project we are spefically targeting the NBA. I was able to search through their NBA data collection set in order to find the right database needed for my analysis on the NBA Finals and NBA league MVPs. I believe that these Excel files that I will transform into CSV files that I have collected will be ideal to use for machine learning processes in order to find the performance results and outcomes I am searching for.

### Questions we will try to answer in our analysis
- How many times has the League MVP been on the NBA CHampionship team?
- What is the amount of times an NBA League MVP has not been on the league championship team?
- What are the teams with the highest and lowest MVPs and how doe they correlate to that teams championship count?
- What is the highest amount of the speificed Position for the NBA League MVP?

### Communication Protocols
for my project as far as communication, I am working solo on this project. However, I will creating a list of all the requirments for each week from the Rubrics given for each segment. This will keep me in order and on time to develop our project at the right pace.
