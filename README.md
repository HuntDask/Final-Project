# Final-Project
## NBA Finals and League MVP

### Topic
For my final project, I will be examining a database of the 2018-2019 NBA Champion Toronto Raptors to study their production and performance numbers in their historic run.

### Topic Reasoning
I will be researching the 2018-2019 Toronto Raptors to examine the correlations between the teams and players different NBA statistics during the regular season and playoffs. To study the data collected, we will be examining by downloading a dataframe of the different NBA stastics for the Toronto Raptors such as Team and Player stat lines from the season in order to analyze and explain performance results. We will do this by creating models through machine learning, database collection analysis, and a google presentation in order to explain the difference charactersistics and sttisitcs that went towards the 2018-2019 Raptors championship team.

### Description of data source
For my data source, I was able to find a dataset off the data website Kaggle. I was able to find four main CSV files that examine both the Raptors team and player statistics. From this website, you can access many different sporting stasticics from all over, and for our project we are specifically targeting the NBA. I was able to search through their NBA data collection set in order to find the right database needed for my analysis on the Chapionship winning Toronto team. I believe that these CSV files that I have collected through research will be ideal to use for machine learning processes in order to find the performance results and outcomes I am searching for.

### Questions we will try to answer in our analysis:
- what is the correlation between the main NBA recors stastitics(points, assists, attempts, fouls, turnovers) and the outcome of each game.
- What is the correlation between the amount of turnovers and and points made overall by the team.
- What is the correlation between the difference of wins and losses for a team while playing at home and away.
- What is the correlation between the amount of minutes played and the overall score of the players.


### Communication Protocols
for my project as far as communication, I am working solo on this project. However, I will creating a list of all the requirments for each week from the Rubrics given for each segment. This will keep me in order and on time to develop our project at the right pace. 

## DataBase
For our database, I started by creting a ERD file in quickdatabaseprograms. I was able attach the date through varchar, varachar pk FK, and string in order to connect our different data points together like the match id and player id for example and moved it into a SQL query from the quickdatabaseprograms website in order to sort into tables more clearly.

## Machine Learning
From the data we collected and developed through our ERD and SQL, we can use our machine learning models that we have deloped in class. We will want to use or learning of under and oversampling, and differnt sampling algorithims in order to find what statiscs and categories are the most important for us to develop and study further. we will use differnt columns from the data we have created in our database files. Some of the data columns will be from dates, floats, and integers in order to match of our categories such as teams, dates, points, all the important categories we need to make a evaluation of the teams performance. Below are some of the eamples that we used previously in our database creation in order to start our machine learning in pandas in the next segment.
